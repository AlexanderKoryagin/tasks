This script performs:
- Checks if provided coordinates belongs to the Right triangle;
- Finds coordinates for the Right triangle.

Usage:

```
# sudo pip install pytest --upgrade
# git clone https://github.com/AlexanderKoryagin/tasks.git
# cd task_2
# py.test -v -ra -s -k test_triangle.py
```
_(More likely you'll see 'AssertionError' from the first test. It is OK, it means that triangle is not right)_

This script performs:
- Checks if provided coordinates belongs to the Right triangle;
- Finds coordinates for the Right triangle.
***

Usage:
1. Install [global requirements](../../README.md).
2. Run tests:
```bash
    cd tasks/task_2
    py.test -v -ra -s -k test_triangle.py
```
_(More likely you'll see 'AssertionError' from the first test. It is OK, it means that triangle is not right)_
